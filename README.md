# Global Git Hooks

The path of my local Git repository that tracks this remote is the value of my
`core.hooksPath` global Git configuration variable. This causes the hooks
contained herein to be the default hooks for all Git repositories on my local
filesystem unless there are repository-specific overrides. Thus, the hooks
contained herein are hooks that I want to run from the majority of my local Git
repositories.
